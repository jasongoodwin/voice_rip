# Voice Rip
I've been testing processing conversations to collect important points.

## Setup
Sorry for these notes - this is what I took down. I'll clean it another time.
```
brew install portaudio
pyenv install 3.10.6
pyenv local 3.10.6
python3.10 -m venv .venv-assistant
. .venv-assistant/bin/activate
python --version
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
